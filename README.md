# MediaPlayer
Cross platform media player lib</BR>
based on ideas and code of [martijn00](https://github.com/martijn00) ( https://github.com/martijn00/XamarinMediaManager )

MediaPlayer is basically a clone of martijn00s XamarinMediaManager. It started all when I tried to contribute to this project. </BR>
Any media player is a quite complex project and martijn00 is a quite sophisticated developer. Whereas my first steps went well, I was quickly struggling with the project structure and implementation. When I saw that I took more time analyzing the project than developing features I started thinking about this reimplementationâ€¦ </BR>
</BR>
Doing so I finally I understand many of the tricks hidden in martijn00s project.</BR>
</BR>
So, I didnâ€™t reinvent the wheel, I disassembled and reassembled it ðŸ˜‰
